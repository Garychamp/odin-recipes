# odin-recipes

This is a small project to create a basic HTML website from scratch. I will use the skills I have learned over the course of the Odin Project.
Some of the HTML skills I intend to use in the project include creating paragraphs, bold and italic text, lists, links and images.
The basic website will then be used for the CSS skills I will use in later classes.
I then hope to move on with more customization with Javascript and further courses
